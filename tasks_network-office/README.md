# SciComp Tasks - LTER Network Office

This is the core of this repository; scripts developed generally for the LTER Network Office (LNO). These have nowhere else to live--unlike (arguably) the WG scripts--so this should be the primary place for direct SciComp technical support of the LNO.

## Script Explanations

- **"working-groups_activity-timeline.R"** -- Creates a timeline graph of activities/products per working group (full & SPARC). _Useful for LNO Annual Report!_
- **"misc-lno_webinar-info.R"** -- Wrangle Zoom webinar information
- **"publications_lter-neon-crosscheck.R"** -- Check publication overlap through time between the LTER Network and NEON Zotero libraries
- **"sites_shapefile-polygons.R"** -- Wrangle LTER site polygons into a single shapefile
- **"sites_faq-01.R"** -- Step 1 of creating site-level outputs that are frequently requested
- **"sites_faq-02.R"** -- Step 2 of creating site-level outputs that are frequently requested
