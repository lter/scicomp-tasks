# LTER Scientific Computing Team - Tasks

**This is a project-neutral repository for all scripts that don't fit neatly under an existing repository.** Working group needs evolve and scripts that we wrote become unnecessary for the group's project(s) but may still be useful to others. It wouldn't make sense to force every group to store useless (to them) scripts, so we house them here in case their hypothetical utility is realized.

## Repository Structure Explanation

- `tasks_network-office/` -- scripts made for the LTER Network Office
- `tasks_working-groups/` -- standalone scripts made for working groups but not ultimately useful to them
- `tools/` -- custom functions useful--at least--for other scripts in this repository
- `guides/` -- educational materials (e.g., workshop code, tutorials, etc.) that might be useful fodder for more complete workshops/tutorials to be added to the team website
