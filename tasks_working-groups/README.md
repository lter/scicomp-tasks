# SciComp Tasks - Working Groups

This is the core of this repository; scripts developed at the behest of working groups but that wind up not being directly useful to them.

## Script Explanations

- **"data-templates_ecocomdp-vs-neon.R"** -- Compare ecocomDP acquisition / wrangling to NEON acquisition / wrangling
- **"spp-community_rarefaction.R** -- Explore different methods of rarefaction in R
- **"time-series_prune-tails.R"** -- Prune time series data that start or end with long runs of zeros (or low values). Uses simulated data and generates a comparison plot
